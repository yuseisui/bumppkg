# bumppkg

Bump a package version like `npm version`

> **Note**
> npm users should use `npm version`.
> Basically I created bumppkg to fulfill my own needs to do the same as `npm version` without npm.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g bumppkg
```

You can also use without global installation:

```bash
yarn dlx bumppkg ... # for yarn
pnpm dlx bumppkg ... # for pnpm
```

## Usage

```bash
bumppkg [options] <newversion>
```

See `bumppkg --help` for details.
